> *-- Yeah, but how could you be so sure?*
> *-- 'Cause it's **signals**, Jerry. It's **signals**! Don't you know it.. all right.*
> *-- Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?*
> *-- No.*
> *-- She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that?*
> *It's Saturday night!*
> *-- Yeah.*
> *-- What is that? It's ridiculous! You don't even know, what hotel she's*
> *staying at, you can't call her. That's a **signal**, Jerry, that's a **signal**!*
