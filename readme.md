Common, you know what this is.

> _-- I can't believe: WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!_  
> _-- Yeah, but how could you be so sure?_  
> _-- 'Cause it's **signals**, Jerry. It's **signals**! Don't you know it.. all right._
  _Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?_  
> _-- No._  
> _-- She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that?
  It's Saturday night!_  
> _-- Yeah._  
> _-- What is that? It's ridiculous! You don't even know, what hotel she's
  staying at, you can't call her.  
  That's a **signal**, Jerry, THAT'S A **SIGNAL**!_  
> _-- Maybe you're right._  
> _-- Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right._
